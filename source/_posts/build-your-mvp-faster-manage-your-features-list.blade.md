[({{ $page->discovery_call_url }})](<({{ $page->discovery_call_url }})>)An MVP features list is pretty similar to a specification list. Let's understand what is a specification list?

The specification list/sheet is a document that lists the requirements of your product. It includes all the development tasks and their deadlines, bugs, and errors, future enhancements, etc.

With that being said, the important facet of this article is to smartly manage your features list to build an MVP faster.

\###Features list


As the name suggests, the MVP features list is the list of basic tasks that must be completed before releasing a product. This is what an MVP features list should include: 
The core features that MVP will have at the time of its launch starting with a general idea about what your MVP will do for users.

There is so much that you can add to this list. It's plausible to say that the more detailed your MVP features list, the easier it'll be to manage.

\###So, why are we focusing on the features list?


There's a lot that goes into building an MVP on paper but for the end-user, the main thing is how it is going to solve their problem. Your users will interact with the features at the end of the day. 

A refined features list is a great help in the early stages until the initial launch. 

However, the time between developing the MVP and launching it can be fatal. An unusual postpone to launch is a common thing in startups, and most of them are time-related delays. 

They can be fixed by utilizing your features list correctly. 
Your features list is one of the best utility tools. The only condition is, you must know how to use it. 

\##Tips on how to manage the features list to build your MVP faster



\###Go with the features that you can provide before the deadline

Suppose you have 3 weeks to finish the product and launch it. So just go with the features that you can build in 3 weeks.

Trying to build everything at once will push your launch date further. Choose a deadline that allows you to build features that must be completed before the launch. 

###Write down the features you want to take out

It’s not an everyday situation where a founder and their team lose sight of their goals. One of the reasons; frequent changes while building MVPs. 

It is common to change its features before the launch. You ask users for suggestions and they say "No, I will never use it" and you are bound to change it. This can happen a lot of times and there will be changes because of different reasons.

So, write down all the features that you let go of. You will be able to see how many times you change features and the impact those changes will have on your MVP.

\###If you're running late, cut down the features 

Suppose, you get organized to launch in two weeks but for some reason, your MVP is taking a lot of time. In this case, have a breather and look for the features that can be cut down. 

Sometimes, you have to cut down a few important features. If the situation comes to that, do it.

Try your best to release as soon as possible. With your initial launch, you will be able to meet your goal; to get things out in the world. 

The sooner you launch, the faster people will start using it and giving feedback. That's how you get the momentum.
