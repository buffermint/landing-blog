With the increasing popularity of cloud computing, many companies and individuals alike are shifting from on-premise to Saas (Software as a Service).

One of the main difficulties with on-premise software is that it requires at least one machine to be working to make other machines work. 

It means that if the machine goes down, your entire work goes down.

The alternative to this is Saas which is a cloud computing service. Cloud computing services allow many more people to use one application with almost minimum to no possibilities of software crashing or slowing down.

According to Statista, 4.66 billion people in the world actively use the internet. That makes about 59.5 percent of the global population. With the rapidly increasing number of internet users, it has become easier to rely on SaaS.
