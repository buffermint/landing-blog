It's never been easier to leverage artificial intelligence to build an app. In fact, there are tons of AI services out there that can do it for you.

Some of the best services are IBM Watson, Spinnaker, and Clarifai. They make it possible for anyone to build AI applications with just a few clicks.

You don't need any coding experience or expensive software - all you have to do is sign up and start using these services.

Check out this article that goes over everything you need to know about leveraging AI without having to code.

### What is artificial intelligence?

Artificial intelligence is a field of science and engineering that focuses on the automation of tasks through intelligent machines.

Computers are capable of performing tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence, such as visual perception, vocal recognition, decision-making, and translation between languages.

AI research projects typically involve using various techniques to allow computers to perceive their environment and take actions that maximize some goal, such as solving a maze or driving a vehicle.

Some AI projects create systems that simulate aspects of human intelligence, such as speech recognition or visual perception. They even cut-short the process for which people generally need in-depth knowledge.

For instance, building an app with AI is becoming much more achievable, thanks to the abundance of services available.

### How to take advantage of AI without coding

To call it a perfect world would be too early at this point but be glad that you can take advantage of artificial intelligence to build an app. For that, you do not need any coding skills.

You can either use services that have pre-built, ready-to-use AI solutions like IBM Watson, Spinnaker, and Clarifai. Or you can use open-source software to build your applications.

IBM Watson is one of the best AI services in the world. It offers a pre-built application that you can use to implement several AI features in your app.

It will do speech to text, image recognition, translation, and connect to other services. All that is needed here is for you to plug the features into your app.

You can also use IBM Watson Studio which allows you to code using Python or R. Using this tool, you can build and deploy your own custom-made AI for your business.

Spinnaker is a service that has prebuilt AI features that you simply plug into your application. It comes with speech recognition, image recognition, text to speech, and translation and it's very easy to use.

To get started just enter your SaaS information into a form and download the plugin for it.

Spinnaker is great for those who have programming skills but don't want to write thousands of lines of code for their application.

An open-source tool is OpenNMT which provides you with a pre-trained model that is ready to use in your app. You can build a machine translation system, chatbot, or image recognition/detection system using this tool. The best part of it is that it's free and doesn't require you to install anything because it works online.

There are several tools to leverage AI without coding like IBM Watson, Spinnaker, and OpenNMT. Just do some research and pick the one that's best for your application.



### The benefits of using these services

The benefits of the tools for leveraging AI without coding are plenty. You don't have to spend time writing code or training your models. You can just plug in the service and it will do all the work for you.

The tools mentioned above offer pre-built models that take care of the heavy lifting for you. Some of them even provide development tools that give you the ability to customize them to your liking.

The process can still be a little more involved than using other general-purpose programming tools like Excel or PowerPoint, but it's well worth the effort.

After all, you are building an app without having to invest lots of time in code. Isn't that something?

Or if you still looking to save some cost and the best agency experience, you can simply book a [discovery call](https://calendly.com/buffermint/30min?month=2021-08) with [BufferMint](https://buffermint.com/). We take your idea to market in 45 days or less on a fixed budget.

### Why you should use them for your next project

The best reason to use AI for your next project is that it will save you time and money. Save time by avoiding lengthy coding processes. It's true when they say that time is money.

The more time you spend coding, the less time you have to do other things.

Another good reason to use AI is that it's making technology more accessible for everyone. The AI-powered coding services provide the tools necessary for turning just an idea into a fully functioning application in just a few minutes!

With AI it does not matter whether you know to code or not, you will be able to build an app like a professional.

AI platforms automate a lot of the repetitive tasks involved in building an app, so you don't have to do anything from scratch.

You can launch a business with only one person or hire someone who knows how to use AI services instead of hiring a team.

Let's say you want to create an application that helps people find their lost pets. The pet store database is updated manually by the team of workers, but with AI, it's done automatically and instantly.

This technology can be used to scan and find the pets that are missing. If someone sees the pet, they can click on a link with a description or photo of the pet, and the app will connect them with the owner of the pet.

The process is also simple.

You just need to create an account on the AI service website and use their intuitive dashboard, where you can choose from any of their ready-made templates or request help from the developer community.

They provide every step of the process from the point you sign up to the moment your app is live and ready for download.

### Conclusion

In this article, we hope to have given you a better understanding of what AI is and how it can be used without coding.

Whether you're looking to build an app for your business, create a new website or automate tasks in your office, there are many options available that will help get the job done with minimal work on your end.

To get started with AI services, all you need to do is decide what application you want to create and choose the right platform that best fits your needs.

Be sure to explore the benefits these services offer and consider them as part of your next project.
