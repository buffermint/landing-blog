According to a study by Stanford University, about 90% of startups fail. This is because they can't find traction.

It's important for you to know what your product does or in other words what's the problem that it solves. Who is it for? Find clear and solid answers for these before you launch. Once you've launched your SaaS startup. You need a few customers. How about 10 to begin with?

**Why do you need just 10 customers at first?**

Your first set of customers will have to be your core audience and no one else. This is one of your strongest points because unlike your competition you will have a commanding authenticity. 

A small customer base will be easier to serve. That will be a great help to even refine the product as per the user's feedback.

We will walk you through the steps needed to find those people and sell them SaaS products. 

## Approach like-minded people

The ultimate goal is to create a community around your SaaS product, select a certain type of customer that will be the best fit for the product.

Your first customers will always be people like yourself. But where to find them? It's easier than it seems. You do not need too many, just 10 people will be enough as a reliable customer base.

The first group that comes to mind is other founders you know in person. It can even be someone from your family or friend list. You need like-minded people who would love to pay for what you're offering.

There's a low-hanging fruit that will connect you will almost anyone, that is social media platforms. Utilize social media to get in touch with some people who will become potential.

The other group is the people you meet through community events like meetups and conferences because you have to rely on your gut feeling and not scrutinize your judgment. If you feel the connection you might as well approach them. 

## Determine the good and bad prospects 

You will have to make conscious efforts in order to make the sale. That's why going to bad prospects will be a waste of time and effort. 

Good prospects are the people who would use and pay for your product in the beginning. These are the people that you will not waste your time when you present your product to them. If they like it, they will buy it.

Bad prospects are those who would not use or pay for your product even if you have presented it to them in person. They will not show interest in using what you have to offer, and they will not see the use of your product for themselves. You should not waste any time with them

How do you know someone is a good prospect?

Just ask yourself these questions: “Will this person use my product? Will they pay for it if I offer it at the right price? When you hear yes, you would know that you're selling to the right person.

Also, beware of those who say 'maybe I will try it'. This means that they do not imagine themselves using the product. You should not waste your time with them. They are bad prospects.

Avoid talking to people who will not be able to afford your product or service at the beginning. If they cannot pay for it in the beginning, then they certainly will never buy it later on (unless you drastically change its price).

## How to talk to your customers

It is the crucial step for the conversion. A word here or there will cost you the sale which you were about to make. So be mindful of your words and the customer's time.

Talk to the customers about the features of your SaaS product. And how it is going to make their life easier or better. Emphasize how your offering is different from others in the market.

Always try to make valuable conversations with your customers. It matters very little if you are talking to your customers on call, via email, or face-to-face, the important thing is to keep their needs and your features in contrast.

The new customers can help you to scale but the existing customers will help you grow. Invest some time in a compelling communication strategy that covers both the bars for you.

Also, ensure that you give support and tutorials for your SaaS product, especially your new customers. Thorough communication and support will enhance the overall user experience.

The next step is to,

## Follow up with the customers

Stay in touch with them. In the initial stages, we are talking about 10 customers here, maybe a few more but you can manage to talk to them if you will take some time out. 

Don't give them an email id, instead give them a contact number where they can call you and discuss their problems with you. This way you will be able to build a human rapport with your customers. Also, you would see the customer's interest level in your product. 

If you do this right the next thing you see is that one of your customers might become a loyal customer. 

**Conclusion:**

If you are a SaaS startup founder, it can be hard to land your first few customers. The best way to find good prospects is by talking only to those who would use and pay for the product in its early stages.

You should avoid wasting time with bad prospects or people who cannot afford your product from day one.

Use the techniques I described above to get your first 10 customers.
