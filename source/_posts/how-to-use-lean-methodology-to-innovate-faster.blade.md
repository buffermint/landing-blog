Lean is a methodology that focuses on building the right product with the right features at the right time while minimizing waste and maximizing customer satisfaction. It's a methodology that can be applied to any industry-especially technology-to allow for better innovation, faster production, and higher quality of work.

Lean philosophy was developed by Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan during World War II. At this point in time, there was an issue with producing cars quickly enough to meet demand because of supply chain disruptions caused by war efforts such as rationing of steel supplies and rubber tires. The company needed to find a way to produce more vehicles despite these challenges, so they came up with what became known as Lean Manufacturing or just Lean for short.

The principles were introduced in a book by James P. Womack, Daniel Roos, and Daniel Jones in their 1990 book titled "The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production" which documents Toyota's manufacturing methods. The principles were based on ideas that had been used by Japanese manufacturers for many years prior to its formalization and popularization by Toyota.  

The philosophy of Lean methodology is to eliminate waste. Waste in this case refers to any activity that doesn't directly add value to the end product. It can either be in form of material or time; for example, excessive inventory, defects, and rework are considered wastes as well as waiting time while your employees perform non-value-added tasks such as going to get materials or waiting for one part of the production line to finish so that you can continue with the next step. Lean methodology is based on the idea that any unnecessary waste means less throughput and therefore less efficiency in terms of profit.

### 5 principles of Lean Methodology

* **Respect** - The respect Lean has for all the people who are part of the production process plays a big role in making this principle work. It promotes the idea that everyone has value and contribution to make in their work.
* **Genchi Genbutsu** - Genchi Genbutsu means "to go and see" in Japanese. This principle also stresses on going to where the problem is to identify and eliminate it.
* **Reduction of Waste** - One of the main principles in Lean methodology is waste elimination. From large scale to small scale, companies should do their best to reduce all forms of waste
* **Pull Strategy and Perfection** - Think about how you work on projects. Do you always pull things that are needed or do you wait for something else to come first? This principle focuses on pulling what you need at the right time. It also focuses on the elimination of defects and making sure that all processes are great.
* **Continuous Improvement** - This principle is not limited to Lean methodology alone. Continuous improvement should be a part of every company's culture to ensure better customer satisfaction

**There are also 4 key components in Lean methodology: Process view, Value stream, Flow and Pull.**

In a **process view**, you should be able to identify all the steps involved in producing something and the costs for each step respectively. You will then have the opportunity to improve on your processes after finding areas of improvement that can eliminate waste from production.  

Using **value stream** mapping will help you track how much time things take to get from the beginning of a process to the end. A value stream mapping will help you see where improvements can be made and how much waste there is.

Using **flow**, you should have an easy time identifying processes that clog up and slow down your production line because they are not aligned with your company's culture or your customers' needs. Flow aligns your processes to get rid of bottlenecks and build a smooth production line.  

Customer **pull** is the last component in Lean methodology that should be applied when it comes to innovation. The idea behind this component is to know what consumers want so you can build better products for them in order to make sure they are happy with your product.

Lean methodology is a way to innovate faster and create better products for your customers. It has been applied in various industries with tremendous success and it doesn't have any limits when it comes to improving processes.

### Examples of Successful Implementations of Lean

The concepts of Lean methodology have been applied to multiple companies in the past to create great product innovation. Some exemplary examples are Toyota and GE. Toyota applied it as a manufacturing process while GE applied it as an idea management process.

In Toyota, the Lean methodology was used to improve the efficiency of their employees in making sure that every process is streamlined for a faster turnover time. This created an innovative environment where employees are motivated to do better because they know that any waste or defects were costing the company a lot of money.

GE used Lean methodology to get the best out of its employees. This was done by creating a culture that encouraged all employees to think about ways to innovate faster while removing any kind of roadblock in doing so. In essence, GE created an effective environment for innovation where each employee contributes and puts their best into it. This ensured better quality of work and produced great results.

Google is a great example of how Lean Methodology can be used to innovate faster. Google has been using this methodology for the development of Android OS where they use different parts of the company to create different components in an API that works together when it goes live.

### Benefits of using Lean methodology for your company's bottom line

The first benefit of using Lean methodology for your company is the fact that it will allow for a lower risk. For example, if you want to develop a product, you can use this approach to explore what customers really want. You'll be able to actually get some feedback, and improve the final product before you release it and spend too much money on development.

This means that even though there's more upfront work, there's low risk because you should only have to change the product once or twice before finally releasing it.

In addition to lowering risk, Lean methodology also allows for better innovation by providing a focus on quality customer service and satisfaction rather than just the quantity of products sold. Using this approach will mean that you won't have any excess inventory or additional products that don't serve your customers' needs.

Finally, with Lean methodology, you'll be able to speed up production time and increases quality control by focusing on a single product at a time. This allows for a better executed final product because it will avoid having too many workers who all focus on different areas of the same project.

Overall, using Lean methodology will benefit you by lowering the risk of making a bad decision, allowing for greater innovation and quality control on released products. However, it's important to note that implementing this approach may require some changes in your current business model.

### Tips to implement Lean into your company's workflow

A few tips on how to implement Lean into your company's workflow without disrupting operations and slowing down production time too much.

* First of all, make sure that you have a good grasp of Lean methodology before implementing it. Lean is not something that you can do right off the bat.
* Second, show your team how they benefit from doing things in a more efficient manner. This means cutting down on the amount of inventory they have to deal with as well as cutting down on the amount of waste that they produce.
* Third, be patient and allow for some trial and error with this new process. It's going to take some time before your team becomes more efficient at working in this new way.
* Finally, make sure you start small and test it out with one of your smaller projects. This way, you can see if your team really benefits from this process before bringing it into full force to the rest of your projects.

Lean methodology is a process that focuses on building the right product with the right features at the right time while minimizing waste and maximizing customer satisfaction.

It's a methodology that can be applied to any industry-especially technology-to allow for better innovation, faster production, and higher quality of work. As you've seen from our tips above, implementing Lean into your company may require some changes in how things are done currently but it will almost always benefit your bottom line by cutting down on risk, speeding up production times, and increasing overall quality control.
