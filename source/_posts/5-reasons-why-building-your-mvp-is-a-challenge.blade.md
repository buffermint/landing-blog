title: 5 Reasons Why Building Your MVP is a Challenge
excerpt: ""
seo_description: "Building an MVP can be challenging if you don't have enough
  time or resources. You'll need to plan well in advance and get the right
  people on board who are capable of both executing the project as well as
  solving any issues that might arise. These problems are amplified if you're a
  non-technical founder, so partnering with a technical partner is something
  every founder should consider. "

In the context of product development, a minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers and stakeholders.

The goal of an MVP is to create the fastest path to customer feedback (early adopters, beta testers), rather than creating a perfect final version, with the assumption that in order to include all the desired features, it will be too costly and take too long.

The reason why it is important to build an MVP is so that you can collect feedback from your potential customers. With this feedback, you are able to make the necessary tweaks and changes to the final version of your product.

The benefits of building an MVP are:

* You can find out if there is actually a need for your product or idea.
* It helps you narrow in on your target audience.
* It helps you identify which features are going to be relevant and important for your audience.
* You will have a platform that you can produce other products from as the MVP gets updated and improved.

\### Five challenges in building your own MVP

1. Lack of time or resources

Building an MVP will take time and resources, and if you do not have these two things, it might be hard to build your own MVP.

2. Lack of technical skills or knowledge

If you are a non-technical founder, it is challenging to build your own MVP without the support of a technical partner who specializes in building MVPs as their core business.

3. Non-technical founders may not be able to identify the right MVP

Building an MVP that fits your product/service is also a challenge on its own. Choosing the wrong set of features for the initial offering can cause a good product to fail even in the right market.

4. Analyzing the market

Even though you might have an awesome idea for a product, without doing your market research first, it can be difficult to know if there is demand for what you have to offer. This challenge becomes more apparent when creating a market that does not exist in spite of your excellent idea.

5. Scalability

An MVP must be built with scalability in mind so that you can add new, relevant features as the product or service continues to evolve. You do not want to have to completely redesign your MVP every time you need to add a new feature. When building an MVP, you will need to make sure that it is scalable for future updates and features.

You can overcome these challenges by planning ahead and getting the right people on board.

* You need to know, for example, how much time and resources you will need, who will be able to carry out the project, what features should be in your MVP, and how scalable it needs to be.
* You also need to evaluate possible risks, determine the budget and make sure you understand who your audience is.

If you are a non-technical founder, partnering with someone will allow you to focus on other parts of running a successful company rather than spending time trying to build everything yourself. They can also help you with other aspects of building an MVP such as identifying potential features, how to make it scalable and which features should be included.
