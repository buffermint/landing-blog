**Micro-SaaS is all the rage right now.**

Find a problem, solve it for a niche, build the product and go to market. It's a disruptive idea that has shown major promise in today's market.

The philosophy of micro-SaaS is all about solving niche problems and offering a great, simple solution to these small problems. The beauty behind Micro-SaaS is that it enables you to build your product as quickly as possible.

Micro-SaaS is also considered less risky because it's a small project with a lower risk. It's much easier to get started with the idea of Micro-SaaS and you won't need as much funding or resources to make it work as when starting a larger project.

You can test out a new idea, or build a simple app and see how it goes.

I believe it is the future of SaaS because it gives smaller companies and individuals a chance to compete with larger organizations and create their own niche. It's scaled to the size of your company.

Even when you're a one or two-person operation, you can quickly move forward and market your company without having to worry about scalability. It also saves time, money, and resources that you might otherwise spend on web development or marketing.

If you're a founder looking to launch a new idea. Micro-Saas is a great way to get your idea off the ground without spending too much time and resources on complex infrastructure. The best thing you can do is niche down, figure out what niche you want to operate in.

It requires lots of research, lots of trial and error, and many broken ideas. The first thing you need to consider is your personal expertise. You should play to your strengths if possible. Niche down into something that you are passionate about. Consider what differentiates you from other people who might be offering products in your industry.
