**We are BufferMint.** We Design, Build & Launch products for founders. We are a unique design and development studio and our sole focus is building amazing products for founders.

Say you have an amazing idea to improve how something is done right now. An idea that solves a real problem for a viable customer base.

Founders get excited about their products and would love to take them from concept through to launch up themselves, but very few people have coding skills, experience in design, or time to do it.

This is where we come inâ€¦

We take your idea to market in 45 days or less on a fixed budget.

### Why we started BufferMint?

In 2019, before the COVID pandemic hit we were working as a consulting team, helping clients all over the world to build and support their existing products and internal systems.

Most of these products were one-off projects and our level of engagement was very limited. We loved the challenge and the opportunity, but as technical partners, we were working on products where we were not very invested in the projects.

We wanted to do more.

No, not just more, we wanted to build services and products that would help people like us and focus on what we do best, solve problems.

### What do we do?

We look at services differently.

We are not a services company, we do not only offer services to our clients; instead, we design, build and launch services for founders as their technology partners.

We do this from ideation to market. We get excited about services or products and put our blood, sweat, and tears into making them a reality. We are the partners you need, when you need them, with no bureaucracy and no crap!

We do like working on X for Y types of projects, like a social network for pet owners or uber for florists. We work with people who are passionate about their idea and want to build something which solves a real problem. We only work with founders who have first-hand experience working in the industry in which they want to launch a product.


**Our process looks something like this,**

<x-list :list='[
    "Brainstorm your MVP <br/> In this step, we map out a version of your product with just enough features to be loved by early customers who can then provide feedback for future iterations.",
    "Design and Build <br/> After the MVP is planned and approved by you, we design and develop the product. We keep you in the loop and utilize your domain knowledge through everyday feedback.",
    "Launch and Reiterate <br/> After launching the MVP, we help you to gain traction for the product using multiple channels. We work with you to collect user feedback and plan upcoming features and releases.",
]' />


If you think we are a good fit. Let us help you launch an exceptional product. [Book a discovery call now]({{ $page->discovery_call_url }}).
